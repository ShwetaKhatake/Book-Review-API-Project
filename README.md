### Design Decisions & Assumptions
1. Used JWT + HTTP-only cookie for secure token storage and session handling
2. MongoDB used for its schema flexibility and ease of integration with Mongoose
3. EJS used for rendering dynamic UI with Bootstrap
4.  Each user can leave only one review per book
5.  Reviews are paginated under each book
